      Cincinnati (/ˌsɪnsɪˈnæti/ SIN-si-NAT-ee) is a city in the U.S. state of
      Ohio and the county seat of Hamilton County.[10] Settled in 1788, the city
      is located at the northern side of the confluence of the Licking and Ohio
      rivers, the latter of which marks the state line with Kentucky. The city
      is the economic and cultural hub of the Cincinnati metropolitan area. With
      an estimated population of 2,256,884, it is Ohio's largest metropolitan
      area and the nation's 30th-largest,[11] and with a city population of
      309,317, Cincinnati is the third-largest city in Ohio and 65th in the
      United States. Throughout much of the 19th century, it was among the top
      10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by New Orleans and the older,
      established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as
      being the sixth-most populous city from 1840 until 1860.
